Front End Task

The task is to build a webpage using Vue.js.

The webpage should use the World Time API (http://
worldtimeapi.org/) to retrieve its data.

First the webpage should allow the user to select any area from
the api, for example ‘Europe’.

From there, the user should be able to select any location in the
selected area, for example ‘Europe/London’.

The webpage should then display the current time in that
location and area.

Please use git for source control, and make your code available
online through GitHub, Gitlab, or Bitbucket.
